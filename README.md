Hello!

My name is Rob Teszka.
I am a former academic, semi-professional magician, and partially-taught clown who sometimes works on a train.

I am teaching myself how to do web development, database work, and data science & visualization using <strong>HTML, CSS, Javascript, MySQL, and Python</strong>.
